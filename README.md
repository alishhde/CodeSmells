## Duplicate Code
Duplication usually occurs when multiple programmers are working on different parts of the same program at the same time. Since they’re working on different tasks, they may be unaware their colleague has already written similar code that could be repurposed for their own needs.

There’s also more subtle duplication, when specific parts of code look different but actually perform the same job. This kind of duplication can be hard to find and fix.
